# Elevator-Controller (FSM Based)

- 🚀 Designed and implemented a floor-based elevator control system using Verilog with intelligent direction persistence and dynamic request handling.  
- 🧠 Developed a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage elevator movement logic across multiple floors.  
- ✏️ Created comprehensive testbenches covering corner cases such as:  
  - Simultaneous floor requests  
  - Last-moment input changes before floor arrival  
- ✅ Verified functionality through rigorous simulation to ensure responsiveness, efficiency, and correctness in edge scenarios.
