# Elevator-Controller (FSM Based)

ðŸš€ Designed and implemented a floor-based elevator control system using Verilog with intelligent direction persistence and dynamic request handling.
ðŸ§  Developed a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage elevator movement logic across multiple floors.
ðŸ§ª Created comprehensive testbenches covering corner cases such as:
            Simultaneous floor requests
            Last-moment input changes before floor arrival
âœ… Verified functionality through rigorous simulation to ensure responsiveness, efficiency, and correctness in edge scenarios.
